                <li className="mb-3">We have added more than 1000 images in the database. We will be adding images frequently to this website and keeping you notified.</li>
                <li className="mb-3">This is a project concerning analysis of big data. We will <strong>keep informing you</strong> well in advance when we plan to study a substantial amount of answers and hence conclude a round. Such rounds will keep going on from time to time. Hence kindly finish answering the dataset as early as possible.</li>
                <li className="mb-3">When you login, you can see that your <strong>data analysis history is recorded on your online profile.</strong> You can also add a picture to your profile. There is other information of the participant highlighted as well.</li>
                <li className="mb-3">This program is a complete online activity. You can learn about how to study galaxy features by following the online sessions mentioned below. The playlist consists of basic introductory sessions on galaxies by renowned veteran astronomer Prof. Ajit Kembhavi (from IUCAA, Pune & PKC) and training sessions by expert astronomer Prof. Sudhanshu Barway (from IIA, Bangalore).</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Once signed up/ logged in</strong>, you need to compare galaxy features from the top panel and select the correct option/s. Based on the images that you answer, a performance badge is given to you which is shown on your profile. This badge helps us determine the overall response of citizens and in future we will identify volunteers/ smart scientist citizens for helping us develop the program. Let's keep in mind that this badge is given for the quantity of galaxy images that you analyze and not based on the accuracy of your answers.</li>
                <li className="mb-3">The accuracy of your answers will be assessed based on statistical and AI-based algorithms which will compare your answers with answers from expert astronomers. In order to improve the accuracy of these algorithms, we need more and more data to get analyzed by more and more citizens!</li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Please keep in mind that in order to churn out certificates and serious scientific publications, we need substantial data to be analyzed by many more smart citizens like you, so please help us maximize these efforts by participating to your fullest capacity and spreading a word about this program.</strong></li>
                <li className="mb-3"><strong>Completion of a dataset from just a few citizens won't help our cause, hence such citizens' initiatives take time to blossom.</strong></li>
                <li className="mb-3">From the online user profile, you can also <strong>connect</strong> with us on LinkedIn and visit <strong>PKC</strong> website to learn about the kind of data driven, scientific, sustainability-oriented work we do.</li>
